# Rolldown Calculator
A web application developed using React that simulates "rolldowns" in the game Teamfight Tactics and calculates percentage of success given user parameters.

The application can be found here: https://jeremytruong.github.io/Rolldown-Calculator/

# About
I wanted to create a calculator that could integrate in-game mechanics into the calculation, as well as having full knowledge on how the calculation is performed.

# To Do
1. Add the option for some augments into the calculation, such as ReinFOURcement and Starry Night. 
2. UI fixes for smaller width screens.
